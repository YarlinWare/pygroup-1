{"name":"Pygroup","tagline":"Optimally divide entities into groups","body":"pygroup\r\n===============\r\n\r\nThis software takes a set of entities and divides them into equal groups based on numeric and categorical variables.\r\n\r\n+ For categorical variables, the model attempts to allocate entities so there are an equal number of entities who correspond to a particular category in each group.\r\n\r\n+ For numerical variables, the model attempts to make the mean and variance of the variable the same for every group.\r\n\r\nIt is based on a similar, Excel based solution: group-allocator (https://github.com/odow/group-allocator). \r\n\r\npygroup can read data either from a database or tab-delimited flat files.\r\n\r\nCheck the example.py file for usage and instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n+ Python 2.7\r\n+ PuLP, an LP modeller for Python, which you can get here: https://projects.coin-or.org/PuLP\r\n+ PYODBC which you can get here:\r\nhttps://code.google.com/p/pyodbc/downloads/list\r\n\r\n## Files\r\n+ pygroup.py - python code\r\n+ example.py - example usage\r\n+ classification.txt - example file showing format.
